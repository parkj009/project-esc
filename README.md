## Overview

Project ESC was created to provide the general public an awesome browser-based game utilizing an escape room concept. It was designed using the following technology stack below:

- ReactJS: JS Library
- react-three-fiber: React renderer for threejs
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS Framework
- NextJS: React framework
- (need backend)

---

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Project Setup

Navigate to the directory where you want to set up a local dev environment. Clone this repo, cd into the folder and run the following:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

npm install: Installs the file dependencies from package.json
npm run serve: Compiles and hot-reloads for development

---

## devDependencies

- prettier: an opinionated code formatter to stick with a agreed upon coding style
- husky: a git hook that improves git commits/pushes.
  - pre-commit: when git commit is run, `npm run lint` will be run first to identify any errors/issues within the code and will cancel the commit if it finds any.
  - pre-push: when git push is run, `npm run build` will be run first to ensure there are no errors in building the application in a production environment. If errors are found then the push will be cancelled.

---

## Testing

To be Added (identify what to use for unit, load, and end-to-end testing).

---

## Production

When you are ready for production, run the following:

```
npm run build
```

npm run build: Compiles and minifies assets
